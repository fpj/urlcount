This is just a pretty elementary example of how to achieve exactly-once
semantics with an application that counts URLs. The functionality presented
here is clearly very limited, but this is just a proof of concept example
to show that for a class of applications, it is possible to have exactly-once
without requiring further changes to Apache Kafka.
